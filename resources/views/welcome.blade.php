                <h2>An easy to use financial tracker</h2>
                <p>
                    While I wanted to track my finances more I tried a lot of financial tools, and the problem with
                    all of these tools was. I had to log into my bank accounts, and enter the transactions one by
                    one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this seems to be not a lot of work, I didn't like it a lot and for that reason I did it
                    about once a month. Doing this once a month is overwhelming because there are too many
                    transactions. You do this for maybe two or three months, 6 if you are really motivated. Sooner
                    or later you stop doing it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There had to be an easier way. I couldn't find it. So I created one.
